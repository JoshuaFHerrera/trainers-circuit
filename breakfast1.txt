Tomato & Zucchini Frittata
--------------------------------------------------
Ingredients:
- 6 eggs
- 1/4 cup of Original Almond Breeze Almond Milk (Unsweetened)
- 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
- Handful of chopped leafy greens (sweet potato greens, or spinach)
- 1 small zucchini, sliced into thin coins
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- Pinch fo smoked paprika
- 2 medium tomatoes, sliced
- Handful fo cherry tomatoes, halved
- Fresh herbs; sage, thyme or basil
- Sea salt & fresh black pepper


Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees

2. Whisk together eggs and almond milk with a pinch of salt. (For fluffier frittata, I like to do this in a blender).  Set aside.

3. Heat an 8 or 10 inch skillet on the stove. Add a bit fo olive oil, then add the chopped greens, zucchini, minced garlic, and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Cook for just a minute or so - until the greens wilt and the zucchini starts to soften. Add a pinch of paprika, stir, then add the eggs.

4. Add the tomatoes, more salt & pepper. Turn the stove off and slide your pan into the oven.

5. Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until eggs are just set.

6. During the last 5-ish minutes of cooking time add sage and thyme on top. (If you're using basil, add it just as the frittata comes out of the oven).

7. Remove from oven, let cool for 15 minutes (or more), then slice and serve. Add more salt & pepper to taste
