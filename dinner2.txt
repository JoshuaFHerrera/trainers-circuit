Roasted Salmon with Spicy Cranberry Relish
--------------------------------------------------
Ingredients:
- 2 ½ pounds skin-on salmon fillet
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
- 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- ½ teaspoon whole black peppercorns, cracked
- 1 lemon, zested and cut into wedges
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 2 cups cranberries, fresh or frozen (8 ounces)
- 1 small shallot, minced
- 1 serrano pepper, seeded
- 1 medium Granny Smith apple, peeled and finely diced
- 1 stalk celery, finely diced
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided


Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Place salmon on the prepared pan. Mash garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, peppercorns and lemon zest into a paste with a fork or a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in 1 tablespoon oil and mustard. Spread on the salmon. Bake until the flesh flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, pulse cranberries, shallot and serrano in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to a medium bowl and stir in apple, celery, vinegar, 1 tablespoon parsley and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

4. Sprinkle the salmon with the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and serve with the relish and lemon wedges.
